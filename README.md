# Pokerprob (working-title)
This is a yet unfinished project, and my first attempt at making a web-app.
It is an app to build intuition for probabilities in poker.
It uses the Two-Plus-Two 7-card ranking algoritm and the HandRanks.dat lookup table to estimate probabilities by Monte-Carlo simulation.
